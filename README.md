Do you use diamonds as currency, but wish you could sell something for less than a diamond, or a diamond and a half? Look no further than the DiamondNuggets plugin!

This simple plugin adds two recipes to aid players creating item shops. Players unlock the recipes by obtaining a diamond or diamond nugget, or when they join the server if set in the config.

You can customize the amount of nuggets crafted from a diamond, the item name (so you can name it "Diamond Shards" or something crazier if you want), and whether to prevent renames.

The custom resource pack shown above is available [here](https://github.com/Tisawesomeness/DiamondNuggets/blob/master/assets/DiamondShards.zip?raw=true) (requires Optifine). If you don't use the resource pack, diamond nuggets will show up as enchanted golden nuggets instead.
